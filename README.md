4th BCI Competition | Jan. 2024 – May. 2024 

•	Competed in 4th BCI Competition: Predicted finger movements from intracranial EEG (ECoG) data, achieving correlation thresholds (> 0.33, 0.45) in model checkpoints.

•	Processed EEG signals using various filters and feature extraction methods for effective model training.

•	Implemented algorithms including Optimal Linear Decoder, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
