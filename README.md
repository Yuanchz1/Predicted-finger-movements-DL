**4th BCI Competition | Jan. 2024 – May. 2024**

•	Predicted finger flexion patterns using intracranial EEG (ECoG) data from three human subjects, achieving a correlation of **0.5610** and surpassing competition checkpoints (r > 0.33, 0.45).

•	Preprocessed ECoG signals with various filters **extracted optimal features**, and applied machine learning models (Optimal Linear Decoder, Linear Regression, Random Forest, **Gradient Boosting**, and LSTM) for analysis.

•	**Minimized overfitting and underfitting** through signal post-processing techniques like Gaussian filters and scaling, enhancing model performance.

**We are eager to explore how deep learning models can further enhance correlation performance and look forward to sharing our progress!**
